# BCAD-Work

BCAD, ICT, Nichola Wilkin Challenges.


Description:

• This repository was created for me to syntax and organise my code in one place rather than upload images to show my work. It's much more substantial and practical as I am able to update my code from my IDE and upload it onto here for changes to be seen in real time. 

Location:

• In the ANS folder contain my answers.


(NOTE: These answers will be updated regularly as they are not the final. Still in development.)
