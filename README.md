# BCAD-Work

Repository created for the 'Nicola Wilkin' challenges, BCAD 🏫.


Brief Description;

• This repository was created for me to syntax and organise my code in one place rather than upload media to show my work.

Where to find?

• In the ANS folder contain my answers.


(NOTE: These answers will be updated regularly as they are not the final; still in development)
